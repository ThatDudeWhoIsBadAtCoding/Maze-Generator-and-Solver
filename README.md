# Maze-Generator-and-Solver
A* and Recursive Backtracking magic :D

Uses p5.js framework for the canvas and dist function, didn't feel like coding those

Just open index.html in browser to run!

Change the commented out **frameRate()** function to change the maze generation speed on line 8 of sketch.js

As for anybody wondering, the **dist()** function calculates the hypotenuse (distance between end and current cell) of a right angled triangle,
moves the x down to the level of end, then draws a triangle and calculates the hypotenuse
