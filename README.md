A* and Recursive Backtracking magic :D

Uses p5.js framework for the canvas and dist function, didn't feel like coding those

Just open index.html in browser to run!


As for anybody wondering, the **dist()** function calculates the hypotenuse (distance between end and current cell) of a right angled triangle,
moves the x down to the level of end, then draws a triangle and calculates the hypotenuse
