# Maze-Generator-and-Solver
A* and Recursive Backtracking magic :D

**SO SORRY FOR NOT COMMENTING THIS, ITS AN OLD PROJECT AND I WAS A DUMB BABY BACK THEN. Maybe ill comment it some day**

**Starting Point is Top-left, ending point is Bottom-Right**

Uses p5.js framework for the canvas and dist function, didn't feel like coding those

Just open index.html in browser to run!

Change the commented out **frameRate()** function to change the maze generation speed on line 24 of sketch.js

The **dist()** function calculates the distance between two points

**Max cell size is 50 and minimum cell size is 5**, the **solve** button highlights the solution of the current maze

***Credit to my friend for making the GUI***

Click on the **Generate** button to generate a maze with your inputted values

Here is a maze of cell size 7 with its solution
