# Maze-Generator-and-Solver
A* and Recursive Backtracking magic :D

Uses p5.js framework for the canvas and dist function, didn't feel like coding those

Just open index.html in browser to run!

Change the commented out **frameRate()** function to change the maze generation speed on line 24 of sketch.js

The **dist()** function calculates the distance between two points

**Max cell size is 80 and minimum cell size is 5**, the **solve** button highlights the solution of the current maze

**Credit to my friend for making the GUI**
Click on the **Generate** button to generate a maze with your inputted values

Here is an image of cell size 10 with its solution
